        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 cup rice flour, 1/2 cup wheat starch and 1/2 cup tapioca starch in a big bowl.</li>
            <li>Add 1.5 cups room temperature water into the bowl and whisk it all together.</li>
            <li>Boil 2.5 cups of water, then slowly add these 2.5 cups into your mixture.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp oil and 1/2 tsp salt into the mixture, and whisk well until you get a nice smooth batter with no lumps.
            </li>
            <li>To steam your Cheung Fun, you have three options- OPTION A: Steam Drawer, OPTION B: Steam with a plate/pan placed inside a wok, OPTION C: Microwave. Refer to the full blog post for instructions on each.</li>
            <li>After your big sheet of rice noodle has been cooked, it’s time to roll it up! IMPORTANT: Be sure to wait for the noodles to cool before rolling (you can dip the pan in cold water to speed up the process).</li>
            <li>If you’re adding filling, place it in the center of your rice noodle sheet before rolling.</li>
            <li>Using a dough scraper, gently roll your rice noodle into a nice tube. </li>
            <li>If needed, cut your roll in half (or smaller pieces) to make it more manageable to eat.</li>
            <li>Top with green onions, serve with some sweet soy sauce and enjoy!</li>
